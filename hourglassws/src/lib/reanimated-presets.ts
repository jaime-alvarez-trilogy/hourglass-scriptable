/**
 * reanimated-presets.ts
 *
 * Named animation presets for Hourglass — Reanimated v4.
 *
 * Design system rule (from BRAND_GUIDELINES.md):
 *   - Springs   → cards, panels, modals, navigation, interactions
 *   - Timing    → charts, progress bars, data fills, opacity fades
 *
 * Reanimated v4 has two animation modes — use the right one:
 *
 *   1. CSS Animations syntax (v4 only) — for simple entrance animations:
 *      <Animated.View style={{ animation: "fadeIn 300ms ease-out" }} />
 *      Use for: fade-in, slide-in, scale-in on mount. Clean and declarative.
 *
 *   2. Programmatic (useSharedValue + useAnimatedStyle) — for everything else:
 *      cardScale.value = withSpring(1, springBouncy);
 *      barWidth.value  = withTiming(targetWidth, timingChartFill);
 *      Use for: gesture-driven, data-reactive, staggered, looping animations.
 *
 * These presets are for the programmatic API only.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { springBouncy, timingChartFill } from "@/src/lib/reanimated-presets";

 *           hold the user's eye for long.
 *

 *           cross-fade rather than snap.
 *
 * Loading skeletons should pulse with this at 50% opacity → 100% opacity
